*This is a short tutorial on how to get the name changing mod functional in all Gorilla Tag servers in 2022. Before you continue on, please read the disclaimer below this message, it is really important to follow. If you don't follow, I'm not responsible on what happens. Also, this is a PC mod only, do not try this on Quest, it will not work and never will. Also Quest mods are still down on the latest versions of the game so you cannot eitherway.*

**DISCLAIMER: THIS MOD IS FUNCTIONAL IN PUBLIC LOBBIES, DO NOT USE THEM IN PUBLIC LOBBIES OR ELSE YOU'LL GET BANNED FOR CHEATING! Eitherway it doesn't effect anyone, doesn't ruin the game for anyone, it is completely fine to use, but it isn't allowed to use in publics. You're responsible for your own mods you download off the internet and then abusing them in privates and publics lobbies. Suggest using them in the modded lobbies that Utilla has inside the tree stump. If you're going in private lobby, make sure to ask if everyone is okay with you modding in the server, if other people think it is okay and others not, suggest you leave and find another lobby before you get reported and then banned.**

File Destination for Steam and Oculus.

Oculus: -- C:Program Files\Oculus\Software\Software\another-axiom-gorilla-tag\BepinEx\plugins

**Instructions on getting it Working:**

Once you've download the file, open the non-extracted file there should be a folder called "NameChanger".
Once you find that folder, you wanna open it by double clicking on it, or by right clicking on it and pressing "Open".

Inside the folder NameChanger that was inside the folder NameChanger which is what you opened, you should be able to find a file called "CustomNames".

Inside the Customnames folder, you should find a document saying "Name_config.txt", this file is used for your name changing to actually change and having you whatever name you want making it visible to everyone.

On the top of the document file, you should find a number saying "30", that number that is listed on the top will detect the speed of how fast your name goes. Which goes by 30 milliseconds being the fastest, and 999 milliseconds being the slowest your name will start changing. (30 milliseconds is the lowest time you can put in the text which will cause the "CustomPrefixError", as well putting 1,000+ milliseconds which will cause the "CustomPrefixError" to appear in your files).

Underneath the number, you should see typing, you can replace the typing to whatever you want such as name changing like PBBV, unique name styles, unusable characters, and even zalgo text.

Once you've finished on what you've written in your document, inside of it, press on "File", and then press "Save". If nothing pops up, you should be good to go, now that you've done that, you want to now grab the CustomNames folder and place it in your Bepinex which is located in your System files. (Destination to the files are above)

Once you have the CustomNames file in your Plugins folder, you wanna check if it says "CustomPrefixError". If it says that error file inside your Gorilla Tag file, it potentially means you've done something wrong and you need to check back what you've missed.

Once you're done with the steps above and made sure there is no "CustomPrefixError" document in your Gorilla Tag files, you may run your game and the name changing should start becoming functional in-game.
